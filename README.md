<h2>Snap Tap CRACK</h2>
<p><strong>How Snap Tap Mode Works
Snap Tap Mode Off
With a standard gaming keyboard, in any instance where two opposing directions are detected, no movement is registered. This causes your character to stop moving and remain stationary for as long as those two keys remain actuated. For any one direction to be registered, the other key must first be released.</p>
